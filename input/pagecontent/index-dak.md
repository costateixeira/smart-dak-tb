### Summary 
The WHO Global Tuberculosis Programme (GTB) works towards the goal of a world free of TB, with zero deaths, disease and suffering due to the disease. One of its core functions is to develop policy options, norms and standards for TB prevention and care and facilitate their implementation. The five-step pathway to advance the adoption of best clinical and data practices for TB is presented below.

### L1 Narrative guidelines
To guide national TB programmes in the efforts of ending the TB epidemic, GTB releases narrative guidelines on TB prevention, diagnosis and treatment based on latest available evidence. In addition to these guidelines, GTB also releases various guidance documents including TB surveillance guidance. These guidelines and guidance documents informed the development of the digital adaptation kit for TB (DAK for TB). The WHO consolidated guidelines on TB can be found [here](https://tbksp.org/en), and the WHO TB surveillance guidance can be found [here](https://iris.who.int/handle/10665/376612).

### L2 Operational guidelines
Digital adaptation kits are designed to facilitate the accurate reflection of WHOâ€™s clinical, public health and data use guidelines within the digital systems countries are adopting. DAKs are operational, software-agnostic, standardized documentation that distil clinical, public health and data use guidance into a format that can be transparently incorporated into digital systems. DAKs serve as a prerequisite for developing computable, or machine-readable, guidelines, as well as executable reference software and advanced analytics for precision health. 

The DAK for TB and the associated implementation tools can be found here:
