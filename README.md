# WHO SMART GUIDELINES - Digital adaptation kit for tuberculosis

This Digital adaptation kit (DAK) focuses on tuberculosis (TB) and aims to provide a common language across several audiences – TB programme managers, software developers and implementers of  digital systems – to ensure a common understanding of the appropriate health information content within a defined health programme area, as a mechanism to catalyse the effective use of these digital systems. The key objectives of the DAK are:
* to ensure adherence to WHO clinical, public health and data use guidelines, and facilitate consistency of the health content that is used to inform the 
development of a person-centred digital tracking and decision support (DTDS) system;
* to enable both health programme leads and digital health teams (including software developers) to have a joint understanding of the health content within 
the digital system, with a transparent mechanism to review the validity and accuracy of the health content; and
* to provide a starting point of the core data elements and decision-support logic that should be included within DTDS systems for TB.

Information detailed in this DAK reflects data elements, generic workflow processes, decision-support algorithms, functional and non-functional requirements as derived from TB and other related WHO documents. Note that the outputs of the DAKs are intentionally generic and will need to be contextualized to local policies and requirements.

The TB DAK publication can be found here [IRIS link].

## Changes and feedback

Feedback and issues about TB DAK can be submitted via the [issues](issues) page, and will be incorporated into subsequent releases.
